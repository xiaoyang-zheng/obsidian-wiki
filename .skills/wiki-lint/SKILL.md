  Audit and maintain the health of the Obsidian wiki. Use this skill when the user wants to check their
  wiki for issues, find orphaned pages, detect contradictions, identify stale content, fix broken wikilinks,
  or perform general maintenance on their knowledge base. Also triggers on "clean up the wiki",
  "what needs fixing", "audit my notes", or "wiki health check". Add --consolidate to switch from
  report-only to act-and-report mode (the "dream cycle"): fixes broken links, adds missing cross-references
  for orphans, corrects lifecycle states, demotes stale peripheral pages, normalizes tag aliases, and adds
  contradiction callouts — all with a dry-run preview and explicit user confirmation before any writes.

# Wiki Lint — Health Audit

You are performing a health check on an Obsidian wiki. Your goal is to find and fix structural issues that degrade the wiki's value over time.

**Before scanning anything:** follow the Retrieval Primitives table in `llm-wiki/SKILL.md`. Prefer frontmatter-scoped greps and section-anchored reads over full-page reads. On a large vault, blindly reading every page to lint it is exactly what this framework is built to avoid.

## Before You Start

**Writing profile:** Before drafting or rewriting natural-language Markdown,
read and apply `Writing Profile Resolution` in `llm-wiki/SKILL.md`. Framework
schema, provenance, safety, and operation-specific requirements take precedence.
Apply preferences only to generated prose reports; deterministic findings retain
their required formats.

1. **Resolve config** — follow the Config Resolution Protocol in `llm-wiki/SKILL.md` (inline `@name` override → walk up CWD for `.env` → global config → prompt setup). This gives `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` plus any `OBSIDIAN_ALLOWED_LIFECYCLES`, `OBSIDIAN_ALLOWED_RELATIONSHIP_TYPES`, `OBSIDIAN_REQUIRED_TRUST_FIELDS`, and `OBSIDIAN_SCHEMA_SOURCE` values.
2. **Read owner rules** — if `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/AGENTS.md` exists, read it before interpreting any schema. Owner rules override framework defaults.
3. **Form the effective schema** — record the schema source locator plus effective required/optional frontmatter, lifecycle values, relationship types, and provenance markers. Framework values are defaults; preserve owner extensions and relaxed requiredness exactly. Never coerce an owner type to a framework type.
4. Read `index.md` for the full page inventory
5. Read `log.md` for recent activity context

Pass the effective schema to deterministic checks explicitly. For example, add each owner extension with `--allow-lifecycle` / `--allow-relationship-type`, replace trust requiredness with repeatable `--required-trust-field`, and identify the authority with `--schema-source "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/AGENTS.md"`. The JSON report's `schema` block must match the schema you formed before findings are accepted.

Schema precedence is CLI flags > resolved environment/config values > framework defaults; lifecycle and relationship extensions remain additive. Strip every override before use. An explicitly configured empty or whitespace-only value—and any empty comma-separated list entry—fails closed; never treat it as a valid lifecycle, relationship type, required field, or authority locator. Remove the variable instead when defaults are intended.

## Lint Checks

Run these checks in order. Report findings as you go.

**Scope:** skip `_archives/`, `_raw/`, `_readouts/`, and `.obsidian/` in every check. These hold frozen snapshots, unprocessed staging drafts, and derived readouts (saved by `wiki-narrate`) — they are not knowledge-graph pages, so orphan, frontmatter, and link checks don't apply to them.

Before extracting body links, exclude the complete block between
`<!-- BEGIN obsidian-wiki:auto-project-timeline -->` and its matching END
marker. Those links are generated navigation derived from membership, not
semantic evidence, and must not affect orphan, hub, bridge, or broken-link
counts. Malformed markers are reported by the project checks below.

### 1. Orphaned Pages

Find pages with zero incoming wikilinks. These are knowledge islands that nothing connects to.

**How to check:**
- Glob all `.md` files in the vault
- For each page, Grep the rest of the vault for `[[page-name]]` references
- Pages with zero incoming links (except `index.md` and `log.md`) are orphans

**How to fix:**
- Identify which existing pages should link to the orphan
- Add wikilinks in appropriate sections

### 2. Broken Wikilinks

Find `[[wikilinks]]` that point to pages that don't exist.

**How to check:**
- Grep for `\[\[.*?\]\]` across all pages
- Extract the link targets
- Check if a corresponding `.md` file exists

**How to fix:**
- If the target was renamed, update the link
- If the target should exist, create it
- If the link is wrong, remove or correct it

### 3. Missing Frontmatter

Every page should have: title, category, tags, sources, created, updated.

**How to check:**
- Grep frontmatter blocks (scope to `^---` at file heads) instead of reading every page in full
- Flag pages missing required fields

**How to fix:**
- Add missing fields with reasonable defaults

### 3a. Missing Summary (soft warning)

Every page *should* have a `summary:` frontmatter field — 1–2 sentences, ≤200 chars. This is what cheap retrieval (e.g. `wiki-query`'s index-only mode) reads to avoid opening page bodies.

**How to check:**
- Grep frontmatter for `^summary:` across the vault
- Flag pages without it, **but as a soft warning, not an error** — older pages predating this field are fine; the check exists to nudge ingest skills into filling it on new writes.
- Also flag pages whose summary exceeds 200 chars.

**How to fix:**
- Re-ingest the page, or manually write a short summary (1–2 sentences of the page's content).

### 4. Stale Content

Pages whose `updated` timestamp is old relative to their sources.

**How to check:**
- Compare page `updated` timestamps to source file modification times
- Flag pages where sources have been modified after the page was last updated

### 5. Contradictions

Claims that conflict across pages.

**How to check:**
- This requires reading related pages and comparing claims
- Focus on pages that share tags or are heavily cross-referenced
- Look for phrases like "however", "in contrast", "despite" that may signal existing acknowledged contradictions vs. unacknowledged ones

**How to fix:**
- Add an "Open Questions" section noting the contradiction
- Reference both sources and their claims

### 6. Index Consistency

Verify `index.md` matches the actual page inventory.

**How to check:**
- Compare pages listed in `index.md` to actual files on disk
- Check that summaries in `index.md` still match page content

### 7. Provenance Drift

Check whether pages are being honest about how much of their content is inferred vs extracted. See the Provenance Markers section in `llm-wiki` for the convention.

**How to check:**
- For each page with a `provenance:` block or any `^[inferred]`/`^[ambiguous]` markers, count sentences/bullets and how many end with each marker
- Compute rough fractions (`extracted`, `inferred`, `ambiguous`)
- Apply these thresholds:
  - **AMBIGUOUS > 15%**: flag as "speculation-heavy" — even 1-in-7 claims being genuinely uncertain is a signal the page needs tighter sourcing or should be moved to `synthesis/`
  - **INFERRED > 40% with no `sources:` in frontmatter**: flag as "unsourced synthesis" — the page is making connections but has nothing to cite
  - **Hub pages** (top 10 by incoming wikilink count) with INFERRED > 20%: flag as "high-traffic page with questionable provenance" — errors on hub pages propagate to every page that links to them
  - **Drift**: if the page has a `provenance:` frontmatter block, flag it when any field is more than 0.20 off from the recomputed value
- **Skip** pages with no `provenance:` frontmatter and no markers — treated as fully extracted by convention

**How to fix:**
- For ambiguous-heavy: re-ingest from sources, resolve the uncertain claims, or split speculative content into a `synthesis/` page
- For unsourced synthesis: add `sources:` to frontmatter or clearly label the page as synthesis
- For hub pages with INFERRED > 20%: prioritize for re-ingestion — errors here have the widest blast radius
- For drift: update the `provenance:` frontmatter to match the recomputed values

### 8. Fragmented Tag Clusters

Checks whether pages that share a tag are actually linked to each other. Tags imply a topic cluster; if those pages don't reference each other, the cluster is fragmented — knowledge islands that should be woven together.

**How to check:**
- For each tag that appears on ≥ 5 pages:
  - `n` = count of pages with this tag
  - `actual_links` = count of wikilinks between any two pages in this tag group (check both directions)
  - `cohesion = actual_links / (n × (n−1) / 2)`
- Flag any tag group where cohesion < 0.15 and n ≥ 5

**How to fix:**
- Run the `cross-linker` skill targeted at the fragmented tag — it will surface and insert the missing links
- If a tag group is large (n > 15) and still fragmented, consider splitting it into more specific sub-tags

### 9. Visibility Tag Consistency

Checks that `visibility/` tags are applied correctly and aren't silently missing where they matter.

**How to check:**

- **Untagged PII patterns:** Grep page bodies for patterns that commonly indicate sensitive data — lines containing `password`, `api_key`, `secret`, `token`, `ssn`, `email:`, `phone:` followed by an actual value (not a field description). If a page matches and lacks `visibility/pii` or `visibility/internal`, flag it as a likely mis-classification.
- **`visibility/pii` without `sources:`:** A page tagged `visibility/pii` should always have a `sources:` frontmatter field — if there's no provenance, there's no way to verify the classification. Flag any `visibility/pii` page missing `sources:`.
- **Visibility tags in taxonomy:** `visibility/` tags are system tags and must **not** appear in `_meta/taxonomy.md`. If found there, flag as misconfigured — they'd be counted toward the 5-tag limit on pages that include them.

**How to fix:**
- For untagged PII patterns: add `visibility/pii` (or `visibility/internal` if it's team-context rather than personal data) to the page's frontmatter tags
- For missing `sources:`: add provenance or escalate to the user — don't auto-fill
- For taxonomy contamination: remove the `visibility/` entries from `_meta/taxonomy.md`

### 10. Misc Promotion Candidates

Find pages in `misc/` that have accumulated enough project affinity to be promoted.

**How to check:**
- Glob `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/misc/*.md`
- For each page, read the `affinity` frontmatter field
- Flag pages where any single project's score ≥ 3

**How to fix:**
- Run the `cross-linker` skill first if affinity scores look stale (e.g., `affinity: {}` on a page with many wikilinks)
- To promote: move the page to `projects/<project-name>/references/` (or another appropriate category), update its `category` frontmatter, remove `promotion_status`, and grep the vault for backlinks to update them

### 10a. Project Membership and Timeline Integrity

Project membership is declared by `projects:`. Body links, typed
relationships, and tags are mentions only and must not be treated as
membership.

Run the deterministic check:

```bash
obsidian-wiki project-timelines "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" --check --json --pretty
```

Report its structured errors and drift, including invalid or missing project
targets, conflicting legacy metadata, ambiguous flat/folder overview pages,
invalid timeline dates, malformed generated markers, and out-of-date timeline
blocks. Do not make `projects:` globally required: old and non-project pages
remain valid. Do not repair generated blocks inside consolidate mode; use the
renderer after the user approves relevant metadata fixes.

### 10b. Source Bundle and Entity Closure

Source bundles are opt-in durable evidence under `_sources/<bundle-id>/`.
Run the deterministic verifier before interpreting a bundle-backed page as
complete:

```bash
obsidian-wiki source-bundles "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" --pretty
```

For each page declaring `source_bundle:`, require an existing valid bundle and
an explicit `entities: [entities/<name>, ...]` or `entities: none`. Every
declared entity must exist, be linked by the source page, and link back to the
source page. Report these as hard failures:

- `invalid_source_bundles`
- `invalid_source_bundle_bindings`
- `missing_source_bundle_targets`
- `missing_source_entities`
- `missing_source_entity_links`
- `missing_entity_source_backlinks`

Do not apply automatic repair to source bundles. Artifacts are immutable; create
a new bundle when the evidence differs. Pages without `source_bundle:` are not
subject to this contract.

### 10c. Backlog Queue

Run the aggregate read-only maintenance queue when the user asks what remains
to fix or when several deterministic checks are relevant:

```bash
obsidian-wiki backlog "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" --json --pretty
```

Use backlog output to prioritize findings across source-state debt, source
bundle integrity, closure failures, project timeline drift, and manifest
filesystem drift. Only write `_backlog.md` with `--write` when the user asks for
a generated queue file.

### 12. Confidence and Lifecycle Schema

Enforces the confidence + lifecycle frontmatter schema (see `llm-wiki/SKILL.md`, Confidence and Lifecycle section).

Two modes:
- **`--check`** (default, read-only) — reports errors and warnings
- **`--consolidate`** — may apply separately approved structural maintenance, but **never rewrites `base_confidence`**

Confidence is a semantic judgment. A deterministic tool cannot infer independent evidence lineages or whole-page claim coverage from source strings alone. Confidence automation therefore validates an explicitly approved manual trust ledger; it never substitutes URL counting for review.

#### Rule 12a — `lifecycle` enum validation

**How to check:** Grep frontmatter for `^lifecycle:` across all pages. Flag any value outside the effective lifecycle set (framework default: `{draft, reviewed, verified, disputed, archived}`).

**How to fix:** n/a (only a human should set lifecycle state)

#### Rule 12b — `base_confidence` range

**How to check:** Grep frontmatter for `^base_confidence:` across all pages. Flag any present value outside `[0.0, 1.0]`; flag absence only when the effective owner schema requires the field.

**How to fix:** n/a (wrong value means the skill computed it wrong — surface for manual correction)

#### Rule 12c — Stale page report (computed overlay)

Staleness is never stored — it is computed at read time: `is_stale = (today − updated) > 90 days`.

**How to check:** For each page, read `updated:` from frontmatter and compute `is_stale`. If stale, also check `lifecycle:`. Report:
- Stale pages with `lifecycle: verified` with a louder annotation (these are the most dangerous — high-trust pages that may be wrong)
- All other stale pages as a standard warning

**How to fix:** `--fix` does **not** rewrite `lifecycle`. Staleness clears automatically when a re-ingest bumps `updated`.

#### Rule 12c-2 — Illegal lifecycle transitions

The lifecycle enum is a state machine, not a free-form label. `obsidian-wiki lint` reports `illegal_lifecycle_transitions` by comparing each page's current `lifecycle` against the value recorded in `_meta/trust-ledger.json` at its last review.

**Flagged:** any state falling back to `draft` (only ingest sets `draft`), and any exit from `archived` (terminal — a restore is a deliberate human delete-and-recreate).

**Not flagged:** `draft → verified`. Ledger snapshots are sparse, so a legitimate intermediate `reviewed` may have happened between two reviews; flagging it would fire on valid history.

Warns by default; fails under `--strict-trust`. Pages whose ledger entry predates the `lifecycle` field have no baseline and are skipped silently.

**How to fix:** n/a — a page that moved along a forbidden edge means either a skill wrote `lifecycle` when it shouldn't have, or a human transition needs recording. Surface for human resolution.

#### Rule 12d — Supersession integrity

**How to check:** For each page with `superseded_by: "[[target]]"`:
- Verify the target page exists
- Verify the target page is not itself `archived` (no circular or chained supersession)
- Verify there are no cycles (A supersedes B which supersedes A)
- Warn if `lifecycle != archived` while `superseded_by` is set (inconsistent state)

**How to fix:** n/a — flag for human resolution

#### Rule 12e — Confidence review integrity

**How to check:** Run the deterministic ledger validator first:

```bash
obsidian-wiki trust-check "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" --strict --json --pretty
```

Use `--strict` for CI and scheduled gates: stale, unreviewed, or missing-page
warnings then return nonzero. Without `--strict`, `trust-check` remains a
read-only reporting command and returns nonzero only for hard ledger errors or
score mismatches.

The approved ledger lives at `_meta/trust-ledger.json`. Each entry records the human-reviewed score plus a SHA-256 fingerprint of material page content and evidence metadata. The fingerprint excludes volatile bookkeeping (`updated`, `base_confidence`, and lifecycle transition fields), so timestamp-only edits do not reopen review.

Interpret results as follows:

- `reviewed` — current material fingerprint and stored score both match the approved review; do **not** recompute from source strings.
- `stale` — body, summary, sources, provenance, tags, or relationships changed; perform a new manual lineage + claim-coverage review.
- `unreviewed` — page has no approved ledger entry; manual review is required.
- `score_mismatches` — material content still matches, but stored `base_confidence` differs from the approved value; fail the lint.
- `errors` — malformed/missing ledger data; fail the lint.

For a separately approved full-vault review, record the accepted state explicitly:

```bash
obsidian-wiki trust-record "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" \
  --all --reviewed-at "<ISO-8601 timestamp>" --approved --json --pretty
```

After a separately approved review of only specific stale/unreviewed pages, update only those entries:

```bash
obsidian-wiki trust-record "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" \
  --page "concepts/example.md" --page "skills/example.md" \
  --reviewed-at "<ISO-8601 timestamp>" --approved --json --pretty
```

`--approved` means a human approved every score being recorded. It is a workflow
assertion, not a cryptographic signature: keep `_meta/trust-ledger.json` under
version control and require human diff review before merging ledger changes.
`--all` is valid only after a full-vault review; use repeatable `--page` for
partial reviews so unrelated stale pages remain open. Never run `trust-record`
merely to silence warnings.

**Manual recomputation protocol for stale/unreviewed pages:**

1. Decompose the page into material claims and map each claim to evidence.
2. Collapse dependent evidence into independent lineages: files/commits from one repository, retries in one task chain, snapshots plus their captured source, duplicate memories, and parent/child tasks each count once.
3. Assign reviewed quality per independent lineage using `llm-wiki` buckets.
4. Compute the raw base score, then assess whole-page claim coverage. The formula is a starting point, not an automatic target.
5. Classify the result as `raise`, `keep`, `lower`, or `repair first`; require approval before changing `base_confidence` or refreshing the ledger.

**How to fix:** There is no automatic confidence fix. Apply only an explicitly approved exact patch, verify its scope, then refresh only the reviewed ledger state. `--consolidate` must never rewrite `base_confidence`.

#### Current enforcement

Under framework defaults, every non-reserved content page must contain a
finite `base_confidence` in `[0.0, 1.0]` and a documented lifecycle value.
An owner schema may relax either field; present values remain validated.
Missing or malformed trust fields, malformed ledger data, and a missing required
ledger are hard errors. New pages with valid trust fields but no approved ledger
entry are `unreviewed`; material changes to approved pages are `stale`.

#### Output additions

Add to the Wiki Health Report:

```markdown
### Confidence/Lifecycle Issues (N found)
- `concepts/foo.md` — missing `lifecycle` field (warning: Phase 1)
- `entities/bar.md` — `lifecycle: stalestate` is not a valid enum value
- `concepts/scaling.md` — `base_confidence: 1.4` is out of range [0.0, 1.0]
- `synthesis/old-analysis.md` — STALE (last updated 2025-10-01, 182 days ago) lifecycle=verified ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- `concepts/outdated.md` — STALE (last updated 2025-11-15, 137 days ago) lifecycle=draft
- `entities/tool-v1.md` — `superseded_by: [[entities/tool-v2]]` but lifecycle=draft (expected archived)
- `concepts/drift-example.md` — confidence review stale: material fingerprint changed; manual lineage + coverage review required
- `entities/mismatch.md` — confidence mismatch: stored=0.80, approved=0.59
```

Append to the `LINT` log entry:
```
- [TIMESTAMP] LINT ... lifecycle_issues=N
```

### 13. Typed Relationships Validity

Validate `relationships:` frontmatter blocks. Skip pages that have no `relationships:` block — the field is optional.

**Framework-default types:** `extends`, `implements`, `contradicts`, `derived_from`, `uses`, `replaces`, `related_to`. Validate against the effective set after applying owner extensions.

**How to check:**
- Grep frontmatter for `^relationships:` across all vault pages
- For each page that has a `relationships:` block, read its frontmatter (not the full page body)
- For each entry in the block:
  1. **Type validation** — flag any `type:` value not in the allowed set above
  2. **Broken target** — strip `[[` and `]]` from the `target:` string, normalize (lowercase, spaces→hyphens, strip `.md`), and check whether a `.md` file at that path exists in the vault. Flag unresolved targets.
  3. **Self-reference** — flag any entry where the resolved target equals the page's own node id

**How to fix:**
- Invalid type: report the value and effective schema source. Correct it only if it is absent from both framework defaults and owner extensions; never replace a valid owner type with `related_to`.
- Broken target: update or remove the entry; if the target page should exist, create it first
- Self-reference: remove the entry

**Output additions:**

```markdown
### Typed Relationship Issues (N found)
- `concepts/foo.md` — relationships[1]: type "contradication" is not an allowed type (did you mean "contradicts"?)
- `concepts/bar.md` — relationships[0]: target "[[skills/nonexistent-skill]]" resolves to no page in vault
- `entities/baz.md` — relationships[2]: self-reference (target resolves to this page's own id)
```

Append to the `LINT` log entry:
```
... relationship_issues=N
```

### 11. Synthesis Gaps

Identify high-value synthesis opportunities the wiki is missing — concept pairs that co-occur across many pages but have no `synthesis/` page connecting them.

**How to check:**
- List all pages in `synthesis/` — collect the concept pairs each one already covers (from its `[[wikilinks]]` or title)
- Pick 10-15 frequently linked concepts from `concepts/` and `entities/`
- For each pair, run a quick grep to count pages that link to both:
  ```bash
  rg -l --glob '*.md' "\[\[ConceptA\]\]" "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" > /tmp/a.txt
  rg -l --glob '*.md' "\[\[ConceptB\]\]" "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" > /tmp/b.txt
  comm -12 <(sort /tmp/a.txt) <(sort /tmp/b.txt) | wc -l
  ```
- Flag pairs with co-occurrence ≥ 3 that have no existing synthesis page

**How to fix:**
- Run `/wiki-synthesize` to automatically discover and fill the top gaps

Offer to fix issues automatically or let the user decide which to address.

---

## Consolidate Mode (`--consolidate`)

Triggered by `wiki-lint --consolidate`. Switches from report-only to **act-and-report** — the "dream cycle" that runs periodically so the wiki self-heals.

### Safety protocol

**Always run in dry-run first.** Before writing anything:

1. Run all 12 lint checks (Step 1–12 above).
2. Print the planned consolidation actions as a structured list (see Dry-Run Output below).
3. Ask the user: `"Apply these N changes? [yes / no / select]"`.
4. Only proceed with writes after explicit confirmation. If the user selects individual actions, apply only those.
5. Never merge pages — use `wiki-dedup` for that. Only link, promote, demote, and flag.

### Consolidation actions (in order, after confirmation)

**Pre-write snapshot** — before the first file write, check whether the vault itself is the root of a Git repository. Merely being a subdirectory of a larger repository does not qualify: running `git add -A` there could capture unrelated files. If the vault is not a standalone Git repository, skip this step silently — no nagging, no suggesting `git init`.

```bash
VAULT_REAL_PATH=$(cd "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" && pwd -P)
VAULT_GIT_ROOT=$(git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || true)
SNAPSHOT_SHA=""

if [ -n "$VAULT_GIT_ROOT" ] && [ "$VAULT_GIT_ROOT" = "$VAULT_REAL_PATH" ]; then
  if git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" diff --quiet \
    && git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" diff --cached --quiet \
    && [ -z "$(git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" ls-files --others --exclude-standard)" ]; then
    SNAPSHOT_SHA=$(git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" rev-parse HEAD)
  else
    if ! git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" add -A; then
      echo "Pre-write snapshot failed; abort the skill without writing any vault files." >&2
      exit 1
    fi
    if ! git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" commit -m "pre-wiki-lint snapshot" --quiet; then
      echo "Pre-write snapshot failed; abort the skill without writing any vault files." >&2
      exit 1
    fi
    SNAPSHOT_SHA=$(git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" rev-parse HEAD)
  fi
fi
```

The clean-repository branch deliberately avoids calling `git commit`, so "nothing to commit" is not treated as an error. If `git add` or `git commit` fails, stop before editing the vault; never continue without the promised snapshot.

If `SNAPSHOT_SHA` is non-empty and the skill writes files, include the SHA in the final report. To discard the entire run, after confirming there are no later changes worth keeping, the user can run:

```bash
git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" reset --hard "$SNAPSHOT_SHA"
git -C "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" clean -fd
```

#### Action 1: Fix broken wikilinks

For each broken `[[Target]]` found in Check 2:
- Search the vault for a page whose title or filename is the closest fuzzy match (use `Grep` across `index.md` titles)
- If a unique best match exists (edit distance ≤ 2 characters or same root word): rewrite the link. Note the rewrite: `[[Oringal]] → [[corrected-page]]`.
- If no match or ambiguous: convert to plain text (`~~[[Target]]~~` → `Target`) and add a comment `<!-- broken link: no match found -->`.
- Never create a new page just to satisfy a broken link.

#### Action 2: Add missing cross-references for orphans

For each orphan page found in Check 1 (zero incoming links):
- Grep the vault body text for mentions of the page's title or aliases (case-insensitive).
- For each mention found in another page, add a `[[wikilink]]` replacing the plain-text mention.
- Limit to 3 insertions per orphan — don't flood pages with links.
- This is scoped to orphans only (different from `cross-linker` which runs broadly).

#### Action 3: Correct lifecycle states

Apply these rules automatically (they don't require human judgment — they enforce the documented state machine):
- **Promote `draft` → `reviewed`:** pages where `lifecycle: draft` AND `created` > 30 days ago AND `base_confidence > 0.7`. Set `lifecycle: reviewed`, `lifecycle_changed: <today>`, `lifecycle_reason: "auto-promoted by wiki-lint --consolidate: age>30d, confidence>0.7"`.
- **Demote `verified` → `stale`:** NOT a state transition — `stale` is a computed overlay, not a lifecycle value. Instead: for verified pages where `is_stale = (today − updated) > 180 days`, add a callout at the top of the page body: `> ⚠️ **Stale**: This page was last updated <date>. Verify before relying on it.` Only add if the callout isn't already present.
- **Do not change `reviewed` → `verified` or any other transition** — those are human-only.

#### Action 4: Tier demotion

For pages with `tier: supporting` (or unset) that have 0 incoming links AND haven't been updated in 90+ days:
- Set `tier: peripheral`.
- Emit a list of demotions for the user to review.
- Do not demote `tier: core` pages automatically — those were manually set.

#### Action 5: Tag normalization

Read `_meta/taxonomy.md` for the alias mapping (e.g., `ml → machine-learning`). For each page, replace known alias tags with their canonical form in the `tags:` frontmatter field. This is a subset of `tag-taxonomy`'s work — only alias fixes, no full audit.

#### Action 6: Contradiction callouts

For each pair of pages marked as contradicting each other (via `relationships: contradicts` in frontmatter, or flagged in Check 5):
- Check whether a `> ⚠️ Contradiction flagged with [[Other Page]]` callout already exists near the relevant claim.
- If not, add it at the end of the "Key Ideas" section (or before "Open Questions" if no "Key Ideas" section). Keep it concise — one line.
- Do not resolve the contradiction; only flag it visually.

### Action 7: Write consolidation report

After all actions, write a report to `synthesis/consolidation-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Consolidation Report <YYYY-MM-DD>
category: synthesis
tags: [maintenance, consolidation]
sources: []
summary: Auto-generated consolidation report from wiki-lint --consolidate run on <date>.
lifecycle: draft
lifecycle_changed: <date>
tier: peripheral
created: <ISO timestamp>
updated: <ISO timestamp>
---

# Consolidation Report — <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Summary
- Broken links fixed: N
- Cross-references added: M
- Lifecycle states updated: K
- Tier demotions: D
- Tags normalized: T
- Contradiction callouts added: C

## Broken Link Fixes
- `concepts/foo.md:12` — [[OldTarget]] → [[correct-target]]
- `entities/bar.md:8` — [[Missing]] → `Missing` (no match found)

## Cross-References Added (orphan rescue)
- `concepts/baz.md` — now linked from: [[concepts/alpha]], [[skills/beta]]

## Lifecycle Updates
- `concepts/old-draft.md` — draft → reviewed (age 45d, confidence 0.74)
- `synthesis/stale-verified.md` — stale callout added (last updated 2025-10-01)

## Tier Demotions
- `concepts/unused-concept.md` — supporting → peripheral (0 links, 120 days stale)

## Tag Normalizations
- `entities/some-tool.md` — `ml` → `machine-learning`

## Contradiction Callouts
- `concepts/scaling.md` — flagged contradiction with [[synthesis/efficiency]]
```

### Dry-Run Output (shown before any writes)

```
wiki-lint --consolidate — Dry Run

Planned actions (N total):
[1] Fix broken link: concepts/foo.md:12 [[OldTarget]] → [[correct-target]]
[2] Add cross-ref: concepts/baz.md ← [[concepts/alpha]] (orphan rescue)
[3] Lifecycle: concepts/old-draft.md → reviewed (age 45d, confidence 0.74)
[4] Tier demotion: concepts/unused.md → peripheral (0 links, 112 days stale)
[5] Tag alias: entities/some-tool.md: ml → machine-learning
[6] Contradiction callout: concepts/scaling.md ↔ [[synthesis/efficiency]]

Apply these 6 changes? [yes / no / select by number]
```

## QMD Refresh After Vault Writes

QMD is a search index, not the source of truth. If `$QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION` is empty or unset, skip this step. Run it only after this skill has written or rewritten vault markdown. If QMD refresh fails, do not roll back the vault changes; report the QMD status separately.

Use `$QMD_CLI` if set; otherwise use `qmd`.

```bash
${QMD_CLI:-qmd} update
```

If the output says vectors are needed or embeddings may be stale, run:

```bash
${QMD_CLI:-qmd} embed
```

Verify the collection with either:

```bash
${QMD_CLI:-qmd} ls "$QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION"
```

or, when a specific page path is known:

```bash
${QMD_CLI:-qmd} get "qmd://$QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION/<page>.md" -l 5
```

Record one of:
- `QMD refreshed: update + embed + verified`
- `QMD refreshed: update only + verified`
- `QMD skipped: QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION unset`
- `QMD skipped: qmd CLI unavailable`
- `QMD failed: <short error summary>`
